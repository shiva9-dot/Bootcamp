# FinTech Case Study: JPMorgan Chase

## Overview and Origin

The FinTech domain I have chosen is the Financial Services domain. The company I have chosen to research is JPMorgan Chase. The project that I am particularly interested within JP Morgan is JPM Coin.

JPMorgan Chase & Co's origin can be traced back to 1799 in New York City. Its earliest predecessor institution was the Manhattan Company. The Bank of Commerce opened in New York City in 1839. This institution merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York in 1929 and is the earliest predecessor on the J.P. Morgan family tree. It was in 2000 when J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated merged with The Chase Manhattan Corporation, and the firm was renamed as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. then merged with Bank One in 2004, while retaining the name. [1]  

John Pierpont Morgan Sr. was the head of this banking firm which ultimately became known as J.P. Morgan and Co. He was an American financier and investment banker who dominated Wall Street. He was also the driving force behind the wave of industrial consolidation in the US spanning the late 19th and 20th centuries. [2]

With multiple financial giants venturing into blockchain technology, JPMorgan Chase announced the deployment of its native digital currency, JPM Coin, via Onyx, on February 14, 2019. It is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. This token was designated to facilitate the company's various cross-border monetary transactions. This currency also has the capability to support advance payment types like DvP (Delivery versus Payment), PvP (Payment versus Payment) and machine-to-machine payments and to help solve common hurdles of traditional cross border payments. [3][4][5]

The company is funded via share prices, net interest income and revenue via financial services, with its largest source of income being its Consumer & Community Banking and Corporate & Investment Banking segments. Other sources of revenue include Asset & Wealth Management and Commercial Banking. [6] According to the financial data from the 2022 Annual Report released in April 2023, JPMorgan Chase had deposits of $2.3 trillion, common stockholders' equity of $265 million and total stockholders' equity of $292 million. It had assets worth $3.7 trillion, making it the world's largest bank by market capitalization. [7]

## Business Activities

Settling cross-border payments between institutional clients usually takes time. JPM Coin exedites the process, with the transaction taking place almost instantaneously. This falls under wholesale payments business where JPM currently moves over $6 trillion daily as part of this business. This technology replaces the original wire transfer mechanism. Settlement times can be cut from days to just minutes (or even seconds). Bank’s institutional customers can transfer cross-border payments in real-time. Generally, SWIFT payments are known to have error rates of 10% or more. This results in payment disputes, which can be avoided with JPM coin by having a verifiable immutable log of transactions that can be verified by the respective parties. In addition, JPMorgan Chase also plans to utilize JPM Coin for other scenarios like instant settlement for securities insurance, replace US dollars held internationally by subsidiaries of major corporations using JPMorgan’s treasury services and corporate debt issuance. [8]

JP Morgan is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. It serves millions of customers, predominantly in the US and many of the world’s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients globally. [9] JPM Coin is only made available to the bank's institutional clients, and only for settling payments. [10]  

JPMorgan Chase offers JPM Coin, which is a digital currency. None of its rivals offer such an option to their clients. JPMprgan via Onyx are the first global bank to offer a blockchain-based platform for wholesale payments transactions, helping to re-architect the way that money, information and assets are moving around the world. [11] While rival firms like Goldman Sachs have explored other solutions like Marcus, implementing a digital currency like JPM Coin would require significant funding and extensive research and funds.

JPM Coin utilizes blockchain technology. It is a part of JPMorgan's blockchain based platform named Onyx Coin Systems. Blockchain builds a decentralized database of digital and unique assets. Through a distributed ledger, transfer of assets through tokens becomes easier and faster. [12]

## Landscape

JPMorgan Chase is a part of the Global Financial Services domain in the financial industry. 

There have been several major trends in the Financial Services domain in the last few years. Some of them are as follows:
1. Open banking and embedded finance: This grants unprecedented access to banking customers by boosting digital experiences, granting faster onboarding and broadening access to alternative asset marketplaces. [13]
2. AI and Machine Learning: It has been estimated that AI chatbots used in baking save approximately 826,000,000 work hours. It helps in increasing productivity and results in better operational efficiency, enhanced personalization in service provision and effectoive usage of data. [13]
3. Regulatory Technology (RegTech): RegTech helps in automating the compliance process processing vast volumes of data at a rapid pace, as the amount of regulation is ever rising. It brings higher transparency in connecting people to processes, improves risk management and lowers error. [13]
4. Hyper-automated banking with Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Hyper-automation helps in expediting financial and bank transactions. By incorporating RPA, it lowers the chance of human errors. [13]
5. Entry of big tech companies: Massive tech enterprises like Apple have entered the financial services industry. The introduction of Apple Card could open doors to additional financial tools such as debit cards or PFM applications. Amazon could also Amazon Pay in-store, attracting more customers. A study via Bain determined that 54% of the respondents trust at least one tech company more than their own bank. Consumer trust is making big tech players a huge threat in the finance industry. [14]
6. Gig Economy Workers: With technological advancement in the financial world, institutions can conduct more thorough risk assessments, which could make serving gig workers worthwhile. Digital gig work generated $204 billion in customer volume in 2018 and is expected to grow to $455 billion by 2023, according to a recent Mastercard study. [14]

Some other major companies and  a few of JPMorgan Chase's biggest competitors in the Global Financial Services industry include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Berkshire Hathaway, Wells Fargo, Prologis and HSBC. Financial data proves JPMorgan Chase is superior to its competitors in this domain. [15]

## Results

JPMorgan has had a huge business impact in the financial world. It has helped to power economic growth by breaking down barriers and creating opportunities in communities across the globe. It has provided business solutions, coaching, and mentorship to help small businesses create jobs, grow and scale. It has expanded access to banking solutions that can help people save, pay down debt and build wealth. [16]

Some of the core metrics and key performance indicators that companies in the Global Financial Services domain use to measure success are as follows:
1. Cash and liquidity management [17]
2. Funding and investment management [17]
3. Market risk exposure management [17]
4. Treasury operations and accounting [17]
5. Risk management and financial compliance [17]
6. Annual metrics [18]

By looking at JPMorgan's overall performance using the above mentioned metrics, it can be determined that it is performing exceptionally well and is an industry leader.

When compared to some of JPMorgan's competitors like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, it can be seen that its revenue growth is significantly higher (29.7%) than the competition's average (2.83%). It also achieved higher profitibality with a net margin of 36.48%. In the second quarter of 2023, its net income grew year on year by 70.97% faster than the average growth of its competitors at 11.4%. JPMorgan's market share is      11.27%, showcasing its superiority to its competition. [19]

## Recommendations

I believe JPMorgan Chase could venture into the crypto world and start their own cryptocurrency. JPM Coin comes close, but it is a digital currency. None of JPMorgan's competitors have their own cryptocurrency, so entering this world could give JPMorgan an even bigger competitive advantage over its rivals.

Offering a cryptocurrency would attract a new set of customers. Entering the crypto world unlocks a new niche for the company, which would further increase revenues and share prices, while growing the firm as a whole. The future may also incline towards the use of cryptocurrency, so making an early move now could set JPMMorgan ahead of its rivals.

A new cryptocurrency will utilize blockchain technology. A firm with an abundance of resources like JPMorgan Chase will be able to enter the world of crypto and make a mark with ease. Blockchain is crucial for the functioning of any cryptocurrency for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. [20]
